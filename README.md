Multispecies insect anatomy ontologies are used as bases for robust knowledge bases for specific anatomical terms ([Yoder et al. 2010](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015991), [HAO Portal](http://portal.hymao.org/projects/32/public/ontology/)), improve the accessibility of morphology descriptions ([Balhoff et al. 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094056)), and are useful for improving the modeling of discrete morphological characters in phylogenetic context ([Tarasov 2019a](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/68/5/698/5298740), [2019b](https://academic.oup.com/isd/article/3/6/1/5584145)).

There are two major reasons why insects are poorly represented amongst multispecies anatomy ontologies: lack of a base insect anatomy ontology and the lack of infrastructure to build such resource.

The ontology for the Anatomy of the Insect SkeletoMuscular system contains terms used to describe the cuticle - as a single anatomical structure - and the skeletal muscle system in insect biodiversity research. The cuticle is the product of the single layer epithelium and mirrors changes in the morphology of this single sheet (like  a blanket). This ontology serves as a root ontology for other multispecies insect anatomy ontologies.

You can find [here](https://github.com/insect-morphology/aism-ODK/blob/master/Simple%20Workflow%20for%20insect%20ontology%20development.md) a simple workflow for editing a fork of the AISM using Protégé.

A manual for creating an AISM-based insect ontology using the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) is available [here](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual).
