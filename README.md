# Ontology for the Anatomy of the Insect SkeletoMuscular system (AISM)

A resource managed by [Jennifer C. Girón](https://github.com/JCGiron) and [István Mikó](https://github.com/teleaslamellatus).

Multispecies insect anatomy ontologies are used as bases for robust knowledge bases for specific anatomical terms ([Yoder et al. 2010](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015991), [HAO Portal](http://portal.hymao.org/projects/32/public/ontology/)), improve the accessibility of morphology descriptions ([Balhoff et al. 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094056)), and are useful for improving the modeling of discrete morphological characters in phylogenetic context ([Tarasov 2019a](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/68/5/698/5298740), [2019b](https://academic.oup.com/isd/article/3/6/1/5584145)).

There are two major reasons why insects are poorly represented amongst multispecies anatomy ontologies: lack of a base insect anatomy ontology and the lack of infrastructure to build such resource.

The ontology for the Anatomy of the Insect SkeletoMuscular system contains terms used to describe the cuticle - as a single anatomical structure - and the skeletal muscle system in insect biodiversity research. The cuticle is the product of the single layer epithelium and mirrors changes in the morphology of this single sheet (like  a blanket). This ontology serves as a root ontology for other multispecies insect anatomy ontologies.

You can find [here](https://github.com/insect-morphology/aism-ODK/blob/master/Simple%20Workflow%20for%20insect%20ontology%20development.md) a simple workflow for editing a fork of the AISM using Protégé.

A manual for creating an AISM-based insect ontology using the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) is available [here](https://github.com/insect-morphology/Manual).

## Versions

### Stable release versions

The latest version of the ontology can always be found at:

https://github.com/insect-morphology/aism

The AISM was submitted for approval by the [OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org/) on [March 26 2021](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/1474))

Once the request has been approved, the AISM will be available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/aism.owl 

### Editors' version

Editors of this ontology should use the edit version, [src/ontology/aism-edit.owl](src/ontology/aism-edit.owl)

## Contact

Please use this GitHub repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/insect-morphology/aism/issues) to request new terms/classes or report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.

If you would like to collaborate editing the AISM or need assistance using the AISM to build an order-specific ontology, reach out to [Jennifer C. Girón](https://github.com/JCGiron) or [István Mikó](https://github.com/teleaslamellatus).
