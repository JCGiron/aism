# Anatomy Ontology of Insect Skeletomuscular System

The Anatomy of Insect Skeletomuscular System, contains terms used to describe the cuticle - as a single anatomical structure - and the skeletal muscle system in insect biodiversity research. The cuticle is the product of the single layer epithelium and mirrors changes in the morphology of this single sheet (like  a blanket).
